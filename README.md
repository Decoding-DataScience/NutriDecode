## Usage

### Food Label Analysis

1. Run the analysis script:
   ```bash
   python food_label_analysis.py --image <path_to_image>
   ```

2. Input:
   - Upload an image of a food label.
   - The script extracts nutritional facts, ingredients, allergens, and eco-impact details.

3. Output:
   - Structured insights in JSON format.
   - Recommendations for healthier and sustainable choices.

### Produce Quality Assessment

- Use the `Produce_Quality_Guide.txt` for freshness and ripeness tips.
- Example insights:
  - **Tomatoes**: Look for bright red color with a slight give when pressed.
  - **Bananas**: Yellow for immediate use; green for ripening.

### Eco-Impact Evaluation

- Run the eco-impact calculator:
   ```bash
   python eco_impact_calculator.py --product "Beef Patty"
   ```

- Insights include:
  - Environmental impact ratings.
  - Recommendations for lower-carbon alternatives.
